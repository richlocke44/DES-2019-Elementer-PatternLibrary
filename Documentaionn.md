<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>A pattern library (also known as a framework or a component library) is a collection of user interface design elements that appear many times on websites and can re-used throughout them. A few examples of typical elements in a pattern library would be navigation menus, social media features, carousels, slideshows, new listings, buttons and various others. Current popular libraries/frameworks are Twitter’s Bootstrap, Zurb’s foundation and materialize which is based on Google’s material design and they all document how their different elements will work and behave, how they will look and how they are coded so that users can apply them to their own websites.</p>
<h2 id="aim">Aim</h2>
<p>The aim of this project is to create a pattern library by looking at the existing libraries/frameworks to gain knowledge of how they look and how they are implemented. A website documenting examples of the library elements is required that includes explanations for other users of what the elements are and how they will be able to use them with code snippets for them to easily follow and be able to copy and paste into their own website.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-pattern-library-80">What is a pattern library? 80</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.webcredible.com/blog/element-design-pattern-library-good-practice-and-top-tips/">Webcredible</a> article outlines that a pattern library is an essential tool for designers and developers that provides them with consistency throughout their work. It allows individuals and teams to focus more on other parts of the production process like innovating and delivering great designs instead of having to spend lots of time creating elements and pages from scratch every time. A pattern is a reusable solution to a problem therefore a pattern library is a reusable solution for creating quick and reliable websites as explained by the <a href="https://trydesignlab.com/blog/pattern-libraries-what-they-are-and-why-you-need-o/">Design Lab</a> article.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-pattern-library-180">Building a pattern library 180</h2>
<p>There are two approaches that can be taken when building a pattern library and they are either to personally build it from scratch or to use a tool to aid the process. Building it from scratch would mean I could use my own layout and styling giving more room for creativity to build the elements in way. It will also make the elements more unique and allow the user to have more control over the customisation of them. However, building it using a tool like <a href="https://patternlab.io/">Pattern Lab</a> or <a href="http://fbrctr.github.io/">Fabricator</a> will allow it to be created using pre-existing elements which is a very simple and fast approach, so it is great for beginners and those who aren’t familiar with how a pattern library should work and how it should and be presented.</p>
<p>From looking at existing pattern libraries and creation tools I came to the conclusion that I was going to personally build my own pattern library from scratch as I had already gained enough of the relevant knowledge on how the libraries are created and work in order to create my own functioning library to how I want it to be.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>From looking at many different libraries, which there are hundreds of that are readily available to most users, I was able to understand how they present their elements, display their code snippets and provide working examples too. The library that stood out the most however was Bootstrap. Bootstrap has a very easy to use site with easy navigation and the first thing it displays on the landing page is a download button for quick installation. Its layout was simple and work effectively for me to be able to follow the documentation. This gave me great inspiration which lead me to design my library to a similar layout.</p>
<h1 id="design-process-method">Design process method</h1>
<p>An agile design process was used to produce this pattern library. The agile design process was established based on the software development life cycle which is used to create software to high standards and quickly. Using agile allows components and the documentation to be revisited if and additions or improvements need to be made or altered which means the library will be produced to the best quality as it can always be added to after being tested different ways at different stages of completion.</p>
<h1 id="plan-and-process-of-testing">Plan and process of testing</h1>
<p>It is important when building a patter library that testing is done throughout the process which should include technical and user testing.</p>
<h2 id="technical-testing">Technical testing</h2>
<p>Technical testing is important because it will ensure that each element is made with no errors and that they all function properly ready for the user to reuse and implement in their site.</p>
<h3 id="documentation-testing">Documentation testing</h3>
<p>Testing the documentation throughout the process is important too because it will ensure the code snippets are correct and easy to copy and reuse. This will mean that spelling and coding will need to be checked regularly.</p>
<h3 id="cross-browser-testing">Cross browser testing</h3>
<p>Some browsers interpret some elements differently, so it is important to test the library in the most popular browsers so that it works for all users with different browser preferences.</p>
<h2 id="user-testing">User testing</h2>
<p>The pattern library is design specifically for others to use and follow so user testing must be conducted so that feedback can be gained in the right areas and it will establish how well the library works for the users.</p>
<h3 id="library-testing">Library testing</h3>
<p>Testing the library will allow each element to be tested properly and have feedback gained which can provide future suggestions for improvements and give an understanding of what the users’ needs are.</p>
<h3 id="documentation-testing-1">Documentation testing</h3>
<p>As well as gaining feedback for each individual components the whole user experience of the library can be tested which will provide feedback on effective the library was to use and implement. Users will be able to give feedback on how clear it was, how well it functioned and how understandable the code snippets were</p>

<h3 id="initial-documentation-sketch">Initial documentation sketch</h3>
<p>The sketch below shows the layout of the home/landing page for the pattern library. It will consist of a top navigation bar with a home and documentation link and a small logo. To the main part of the page there will be a large logo, title and brief description of what the library is and contains. It will also feature a download button and a get started button to allow users to download the library straight away or to get started with following the documentation.<br>

<p>The second sketch below shows the structure of the documentation pages that will consist of the same top navigation as the home page but also feature a side navigation menu that will contain all the different components. The main part of the page is where the descriptions, working examples and code snippets will be displayed.<br>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Two participants were asked to test the library and documentation and asked questions after doing so to gain the relevant and useful feedback.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/richlocke44/Elementer/blob/master/docimages/test.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>From the results in the table above it is noticeable that the users found the library reasonably easy to use and navigate around and were able to use and implement the elements. However, it is also noticeable that there is room for improvement as some of the specification wasn’t fulfilled which was that some of the descriptions were missing from the elements pages which left users unaware of what they were and what they did and like the grid system took longer to implement. The users also may have struggled or taken a bit longer to read the code snippets as they were all one colour and weren’t colour coded realistically. These are things are things will be taken into consideration and immediately acted on in order to get the to library up to standards and to the best quality for users to full harness the benefits of it and improve their workflow.</p>
